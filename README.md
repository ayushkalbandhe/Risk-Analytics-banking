# Risk-Analytics-banking
End-to-end Risk Analytics project in the Banking domain using Python, Excel, SQL, and Power BI. The project covers data extraction, cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and feature engineering in Python and Excel, followed by risk assessment modeling using machine learning. SQL was used for querying and managing structured banking data, while Power BI dashboards were created for interactive visualization and reporting of risk insights. This project demonstrates how data-driven approaches can be applied in banking to evaluate customer risk, predict defaults, and support better decision-making.
